This happens recurringly.\n",
    "This is more obvious for the Pareto distribution, which is also what we learned in class - the Pareto distributions mean value is defined as infinity for $\\alpha < 1$, since no single value can be infinite we should expect that the empirical average will never converge to anything because we will always get a realisation from the heavy tail that is much bigger than all previous values combined that it can inflate the mean arbitrarily much.\n",

    "In this experiment it is clear that even though the mean value takes a very long time to converge, the median converges quite quickly for both of the heavy tailed distributions. This is expected when there is at least a moderate amount of probability mass around the true distribution median, because statistically half of the realisations are larger and half are lower. In other words the tail/outliers of the distribution do not significantly affect the empirical median. \n",

    "The empirical mean and median are of similar note for a Guassian distribution because they converge to the same - they are both central estimators for the Guassian distribution. \n",

    "In our case we see that the empirical mean of the citation counts does converge, but has some jumps like the heavy tailed distributions. To investigate further if it indeed follows a heavy tailed distribution we plot the histogram of all 4 distributions. Here we see that it does not follow a something very close to a straight line as the Pareto and LogNormal distribution, but it is definitly more heavy tailed than the Guassian distribution. \n",

    "For this reason the median is likly a more informative statistic than the mean value. Because there are not many jumps in the empirical average plot, we believe that this empirical average is a fairly good estimator of the mean. (Note: we don't actually know the distribution mean, the closest we can get is taking the average of ALL samples from 2009)"
